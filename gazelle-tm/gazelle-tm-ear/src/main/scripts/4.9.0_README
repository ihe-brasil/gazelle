4.9.0 release introduces two new tables (+ 2 audit tables):
tf_standard and tf_transaction_standard

it can appear that the audit tables are not automatically created at deployment time, in this case ONLY run the two scripts:
4.9.0_create_tf_standard_aud.sql
7.9.0_create_tf_transaction_standard_aud.sql
